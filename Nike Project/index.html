            <h2>Five Things About Nike Adapt BB 2.0 </h2>
            <p>
                The video reactions of players putting on the original Nike Adapt BB ranged from stunned to unchecked
                giddiness. Simply
                put, the experience of slipping into the shoe, pressing a button, hearing the whirr of the power-lacing
                engine and
                sensing an unparalleled fit is like stepping into a time machine. The refining of fit continues in the
                Nike Adapt BB
                2.0, evolving the design principles of its predecessor to improve on-court play, while retaining the
                spirit of the
                tech’s underlying magic: the thrill of a glimpse into the future.
            </p>

            <p>Here is what's new about the shoe:</p>

        <section class="points">
            <h2>1. Bouncier court feel</h2>
            <p>Coming off the Adapt BB, players wanted a more noticeable bounce underfoot — Cushlon alone wasn’t enough.
                Nike designers
                added Air Zoom Turbo to the forefoot of the 2.0, similar to the Kyrie line.</p>

                    alt="Shoes grip">
                <figcaption>The Air Zoom Turbo setup creates a highly responsive cushioning platform that doesn’t
                    interfere with the Adapt mechanism
                    in the midfoot.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h2>2. Better ride</h2>
            <p>
                Finding that harmony between pop off the forefoot and the placement of the power-lacing engine led
                designers to
                reconfigure the midsole stack height. The result is an improved transition from heel to toe while
                moving.
            </p>

                <figcaption>The molded heel piece above the midsole helps lock in the ankle for support.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h2>3. Easier to put on</h2>
            <p>Another area of focus was easier entry into the shoe. By removing the Flyknit shroud, opening up the
                collar and
                integrating a stretchable ballistic mesh throughout the upper, designers made putting on the shoe
                simpler.</p>
            <figure>

                    alt="Easy to wear">
                <figcaption>The stretchier TPU material also allows the lacing system to provide a more adaptive fit to
                    the foot.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h2>4. More immersive detailing</h2>
            <p>An obvious visual difference is the larger Swoosh. A closer look reveals a combination of pixelated
                textures, a
                deliberate choice by material designers to balance the shoe’s über-tech performance ideal with a more
                grounded
                opportunity to sense the shoe in ways beyond fit.</p>
            <figure>

                    alt="Detailing">
                <figcaption>Another example: the lateral clip where the buttons are located has a concave geometry so
                    that the lights better
                    reflects off the midsole’s surface area.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h2>5. It was debuted by point guard Ja Morant of the Memphis Grizzlies</h2>
            <p>Morant wore the shoe during his January 20 game against the New Orleans Pelicans. It will also be worn by
                Las Vegas Aces
                forward A'ja Wilson at the start of the WNBA regular season.</p>
